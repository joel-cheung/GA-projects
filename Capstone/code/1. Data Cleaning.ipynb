    "Twitter is a micro-blogging social media platform with 217.5 million daily active users globally. With 500 million new tweets (posts) daily, the topics of these tweets varies widely – k-pop, politics, financial news… you name it! Individuals use it for news, entertainment, and discussions, while corporations use them to as a marketing tool to reach out to a wide audience. Given the freedom Twitter accords to its user, Twitter can provide a conducive environment for productive discourse, but this freedom can also be abused, manifesting in the forms of racism and sexism."

    "With Twitter’s significant income stream coming from advertisers, it is imperative that Twitter keeps a substantial user base. On the other hand, Twitter should maintain a safe space for users and provide some level of checks for the tweets the users put out into the public space, and the first step would be to identify tweets that espouse racist or sexist ideologies, and then Twitter can direct the users to appropriate sources of information where users can learn more about the community that they offend or their subconscious biases so they will be more aware of their racist/sexist tendencies. Thus, to balance, Twitter has to be accurate in filtering inappropriate tweets from innocuous ones, and the kind of inappropriateness of flagged tweets (tag - racist or sexist).\n",

    "For the purpose of explanation, racist tweets are used as the ‘positive’ case.\n",
